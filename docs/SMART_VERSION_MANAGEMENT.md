# 🧠 Smart Version Management with AI

Our AI-powered version management system automatically resolves version conflicts, suggests appropriate version bumps, and ensures semantic versioning consistency.

## 🚀 Features

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Version Resolution**
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves version conflicts between requested and appropriate versions
- **Semantic Analysis**: Uses Gemini AI to analyze commit messages and determine proper version bumps
- **Context Understanding**: Understands the nature of changes (breaking, features, fixes)
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends correct versions based on actual changes

### 🔍 **Automatic Version Detection**
- **Commit Analysis**: Scans commit messages since last release
- **Impact Scoring**: Assigns weights to different types of changes
- **Bump Type Detection**: Automatically determines if changes warrant major/minor/patch
- **Fallback Logic**: Works even without AI using rule-based analysis

### ⚡ **Smart Release Automation**
- **Auto-Resolve**: Can detect and apply correct versions automatically
- **Conflict Prevention**: Catches version mismatches before release
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensures version in code matches intended release

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. **Commit Analysis**
The system analyzes commit messages looking for keywords:

```python
# Major changes (breaking changes)
"breaking", "remove", "deprecated", "incompatible", "rewrite"

# Minor changes (new features)  
"feat", "feature", "add", "new", "implement", "enhance"

# Patch changes (fixes)
"fix", "bug", "patch", "hotfix", "correct", "resolve"
```

### 2. **AI Integration**
When Gemini API is available, the system:
- Sends commit history to Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Provides project context and semantic versioning rules
- Gets intelligent analysis of what version is appropriate
- Receives confidence scores and reasoning

### 3. **Smart Resolution**
The system can resolve conflicts by:
- Comparing requested version vs. suggested version
- Analyzing actual code changes vs. intended changes
- Providing reasoning for version decisions
- Auto-updating version files when confident

## 🛠️ Usage

### **Automatic Version Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze commits and suggest version bump
python scripts/smart_version_resolver.py --analyze-commits

# Output:
# 📊 Analyzing 12 commits since v2.0.1
# 🔍 Analysis Results:
#    Current version: 2.0.1
#    Suggested version: 2.1.0
#    Bump type: minor
#    Impact scores: {'major': 0, 'minor': 4, 'patch': 2}
```

### **Resolve Version Conflicts**
```bash
# When someone pushes wrong version
python scripts/smart_version_resolver.py \
  --resolve-conflict \
  --current 2.0.1 \
  --requested 2.5.0

# Output:
# 🔧 Resolving conflict: current=2.0.1, requested=2.5.0
# ✅ Resolution Results:
#    Resolved version: 2.1.0
#    Method: ai_analysis
#    Confidence: 89.2%
#    Reasoning: Commits suggest minor bump, requested version too high
```

### **Auto-Bump Version**
```bash
# Automatically bump based on commits
python scripts/smart_version_resolver.py \
  --auto-bump \
  --from-version 2.0.1 \
  --apply

# Output:
# 🚀 Auto-bump Results:
#    From: 2.0.1
#    To: 2.1.0
#    Type: minor
#    Based on: 12 commits
# ✅ Version auto-bumped to 2.1.0
```

### **Smart Release Notes Generation**
```bash
# Auto-resolve versions and generate release notes
python scripts/generate_release_notes.py --auto-resolve

# Output:
# 🤖 Using smart version resolution...
# 📊 Smart Version Analysis:
#    Current: 2.0.1
#    Latest tag: 2.0.1
#    Suggested: 2.1.0 (minor bump)
#    Based on: 12 commits
# 🤖 Generating AI-powered release notes with Gemini...
```

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Integration

### **Smart Version Check Workflow**
Runs on every push/PR to analyze version appropriateness:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/smart-version-check.yml
- Analyzes commits for version bump needs
- Detects version conflicts in PRs
- Provides AI-powered suggestions
- Auto-suggests release creation
```

### **AI-Powered Release Workflow**
Enhanced release process with smart resolution:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
- Smart version resolution first
- Falls back to manual detection
- AI-generated release notes
- Automatic conflict resolution
```

## 🧠 AI Analysis Examples

### **Feature Addition Analysis**
```
Input: "feat: add support for TypeScript linting"
AI Analysis: Minor bump - new functionality added
Confidence: 95%
Result: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0
```

### **Breaking Change Detection**
```  
Input: "breaking: remove deprecated API methods"
AI Analysis: Major bump - breaking changes
Confidence: 98%
Result: 2.0.1 → 3.0.0
```

### **Bug Fix Classification**
```
Input: "fix: resolve memory leak in parser"
AI Analysis: Patch bump - bug fix only  
Confidence: 92%
Result: 2.0.1 → 2.0.2
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key  # Required for AI features
```

### **GitHub Repository Secrets**
```
GEMINI_API_KEY  # For AI-powered analysis
PYPI_API_TOKEN  # For automated publishing
```

## 🛡️ Safeguards

### **Multiple Fallback Layers**
1. **AI Analysis** (Gemini 2.0 Flash) - Most accurate
2. **Rule-Based Analysis** - Keyword matching
3. **Manual Override** - Human decision
4. **Conservative Default** - Patch bump if uncertain

### **Validation Checks**
- Version format validation (semantic versioning)
- Consistency checks between code and tags
- Commit message analysis for context
- Confidence scoring for decisions

### **Error Handling** 
- Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- Clear error messages and suggestions
- Automatic fallback to safer options
- Human-readable reasoning for all decisions
