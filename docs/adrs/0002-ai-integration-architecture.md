Technical Story: Design architecture for integrating AI-powered code fixing capabilities using aider.chat.

## Context and Problem Statement

The aider-lint-fixer project requires AI capabilities to automatically fix lint errors detected in codebases. The system needs to integrate with aider.chat for LLM communication while maintaining modularity, error handling, and support for different AI providers.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for intelligent code fixing beyond simple pattern matching
* Integration with aider.chat ecosystem
* Support for multiple LLM providers
* Error classification and analysis capabilities
* Maintainable and testable AI integration layer

## Considered Options

* Direct LLM API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
* aider.chat integration with wrapper layer
* Custom AI pipeline with multiple providers
* Rule-based fixing with AI fallback

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "aider.chat integration with wrapper layer", because it leverages proven AI coding capabilities while providing abstraction for testing and future flexibility.

### Positive Consequences

* Proven AI coding capabilities from aider.chat
* Abstraction layer allows for testing and mocking
* Support for multiple LLM providers through aider
* Reduced complexity in AI prompt engineering
* Community support and ongoing development

### Negative Consequences

* Dependency on external aider.chat library
* Potential version compatibility issues
* Limited control over AI prompt strategies
* Additional abstraction layer complexity

## Architecture Components

### AiderIntegration Class
- Primary interface for AI communication
- Handles aider.chat session management
- Provides error handling and retry logic
- Supports configuration for different LLM providers

### ErrorAnalyzer Class
- Analyzes lint errors for AI fixing suitability
- Classifies error types and complexity
- Provides context enrichment for AI prompts
- Tracks fixing success rates

### SmartErrorClassifier Class
- Pattern matching for common error types
- Machine learning-based error categorization
- Confidence scoring for fix recommendations
- Learning from successful fixes

## Integration Flow

1. **Error Detection**: Linters identify code issues
2. **Error Analysis**: ErrorAnalyzer classifies and enriches errors
3. **AI Processing**: AiderIntegration sends context to aider.chat
4. **Fix Generation**: AI generates code fixes
5. **Validation**: Fixes are validated before application
6. **Learning**: Results feed back into classifier

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Direct LLM API integration

* Good, because full control over prompts and responses
* Good, because no additional dependencies
* Bad, because requires extensive prompt engineering
* Bad, because lacks proven coding-specific capabilities
* Bad, because requires handling multiple provider APIs

### aider.chat integration with wrapper layer

* Good, because proven AI coding capabilities
* Good, because abstraction allows testing
* Good, because supports multiple LLM providers
* Good, because active community development
* Bad, because external dependency
* Bad, because limited prompt customization

### Custom AI pipeline with multiple providers

* Good, because maximum flexibility
* Good, because provider independence
* Bad, because significant development overhead
* Bad, because requires AI expertise
* Bad, because maintenance burden

### Rule-based fixing with AI fallback

* Good, because fast for common cases
* Good, because predictable behavior
* Bad, because limited to known patterns
* Bad, because requires extensive rule maintenance
* Bad, because poor handling of complex cases
